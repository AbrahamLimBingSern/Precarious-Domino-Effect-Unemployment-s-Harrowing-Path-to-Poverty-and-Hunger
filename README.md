According to Cambridgeâ€™s University, unemployment is defined as the number of 
people who do not have a job that provides money. Referring to OECD (Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development), unemployment is people above a specified age not 
being in paid employment or self-employment but currently available for work during the 
reference period. Even before the pandemic hit, global economic growth had
slowed. Unemployment is a key measure of the health of the economy. It is closely related to 
goal 1 and goal 8 of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that is no poverty and decent work 
and economic growth. When achieving goal 8 that is decent work and economic growth, 
poverty rate is likely going to be decreased which at the same time affecting and achieve SDG 
goal 2 that is zero hunger.
The root of poverty is unemployment. For the poor, their labor is frequently their only 
resource for enhancing their quality of life. Therefore, reducing poverty and ensuring sustained 
economic and social development depend on the establishment of work opportunities. It is 
imperative to offer respectable jobs that empower the underprivileged, especially women and 
young people, while also ensuring financial security.
